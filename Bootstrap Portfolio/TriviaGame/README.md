*Trivia Game 

This Trivia Game goes over some of the facts from Star Wars movies with a little comedic twist. 

One of the struggles through this game was figuring out where was the best placement for the audio file to automatically stream it when game started. It was definitely a simple fix, though through trial and  error I was able to figure it out. Also it made sense  Making sure I put proper notes so I dont loose my placement. It's been a learning process not loosing my placement and being organized, but thanks to my TA's and my professors I've been able to be moreorganized.
