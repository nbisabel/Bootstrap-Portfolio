Some of the challenges that arose from this was trying to understand the whole process of how it works. I'm still learning and that's what I love about this profession. I will always keep learning to do things differently and better. 


My technical approach to this project was going back to the basics of dividing everything into sections. Making sure I understood what was asked of me and start choosing my plan of action. There's still much more I'd like to do to make it look better. But I'm enthused to have been able to make it work. 

In this project I learned a lot about working in a team environment. I learned a lot about communicating effectively and dividing tasks. I'm sure that once in the workforce I'll have learned even more.
