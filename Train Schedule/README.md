Overview of the assignment:

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Instructions

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following: Train Name Destination First Train Time -- in military time Frequency -- in minutes Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time. Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times. Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!


Problems:
One of the problems that I had in this assignment was loosing my place in some instances with closing brackets and more syntax than anything. The way that I was able to solve this issue, was by downloading the app that helped divide each bracket and paranthese with the same color so as to help with keeping track of everything. 

When I approached this assignment, I made sure to do my research on it and I asked my peers on their take on it also. It helps knowing you're not alone in all this.
